*species* is a toolkit for atmospheric characterization of directly imaged exoplanets and brown dwarfs. It provides a coherent framework for spectral and photometric analysis which builds on publicly-available data and models from various resources. There are tools available for grid and free atmospheric retrievals with Bayesian inference, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, spectral and photometric calibration, and synthetic photometry. The package is has been released on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/species/>`_ and is actively developed and maintained on Github.
