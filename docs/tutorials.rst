Tutorials
=========

This page contains a list of tutorials which highlight some of the functionalities of `species`. These examples are also available as `Jupyter notebook <https://github.com/tomasstolker/species/tree/master/docs/tutorials>`_. Some of tutorials are still work in progress and more examples will be added in the future. Feel free to contact Tomas Stolker if you have questions regarding a specific science case (see :ref:`about` section). Please `create an issue <https://github.com/tomasstolker/species/issues>`_ on Github if you encounter any problems with the tutorials.

   A flux calibrated spectrum of Vega is used for the conversion between flux density and magnitude. The magnitude of Vega is set to 0.03 mag for all filters (see also `Stolker et al. 2020 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv191213316S>`_).
